                            <p align = "center">My partner and I designed a game using the MIT Scratch Program. This multiplayer game can be played on the same computer: one player controlling one character or the other using the ASWD or arrow keys to go in a specific direction. The objective of the game is to be the first penguin to eat the fish, by touching it. Throughout the game, various obstacles will come one's way, such as: touching the walls, which returns one back to the starting position, and enemies that move around. Each level gets progressively more challenging, and there are three total rounds. 
                            The player with at least two points will be declared the winner. This game was designed
                            using the pair programming method. I learned how to use different functions in scratch. However, some bugs caused
                            the game to run in a way we did not want it to, but we overcame those challenges by using design thinking
                            and ordered the code in a different way, and chose different commands. Overall, the team dynamic was really good.
                            We communicated well, and the game was finished and had clean code.
                            The purpose of the game was to emphasize the hardships penguins face, 
                            as both prey and predators, to maintain survival.</p>

                        <p align = "center">My partner and I designed a mini golf game app on a tablet using the MIT App Inventor. This game requires the player to swipe the ball in whichever direction they choose, and attempt to get the golf ball to go into the hole with the fewest strokes possible. 
                        There are a few stationary obstacles that will either cause the ball to go in a different direction, or slow down its speed. There is a maximum number of 16 levels, a normal amount of rounds in a regular game of mini golf. There are a few glitches in the program, for example, when the ball goes through the wall obstacle or never slows down. 
                        There is also a glitch in the homepage, where you have to click "new game" to start, instead of normally being lead to begin the game once you open the app.
                        Although we had some bugs in our code, my partner and I worked well to have a successful ran game.
                        Some things did not work out the way we wanted it to, but in the end the game was still able to be played.
                        Our team dynamic was good. We communicated well and both decided on what to do with the game and how to enhance it from the original.</p>

                        <p align = "center">My partner and I used python to create a text adventure. It gives the user a couple of choices and 
                        instructs the user to input their decision. Using if then loops, the program would give different results to the story.
                        There were no challenges, the project was pretty simple. The team dynamic was good because we both agreed on
                        ideas to the story and the ending to the story.</p>

                        We built code that could be used for a client who would like to manipulate images for a cause.
                        We took two images, a solar flare and a picture of the Nagasaki bomb. We applied filters, blended the images, drew a shape and pasted our own logo.
                        Some challenges included getting the images to upload due to the different directories. However, everything worked out
                        in the end through design thinking and trying different things. Our team dynamic was very well, as we
                        both had input on what we should do for the image manipulation.</p>
