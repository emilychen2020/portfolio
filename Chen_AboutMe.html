                                My name is Emily and I am in 10th grade at Dublin High School. This is my first year taking a computer course in high school, as I took drama last year. I thought it would be cool for me to enroll in a course that can help in future careers. I am unsure of what I would like to major in when I attend college, but I hope to either pursue my passion of life science. I believe that no matter which major I choose, having some computer skills will come in handy.

                                On my free time I like to go outside and travel, or stay inside and read a good book. I am a part of a book club outside of school, and I find it fun to discuss and read stories. 
                                I love listening to music and I usually play classical and baroque music on the violin. 
                                I was on the high school swim team my freshman year, and intend to participate throughout high school. 
                                During holidays, I like to bake sweets with my friend Jessica, and they always turn out super amazing! 
                                I have been involved in a garden club since 5th grade, and I hold an immense amount of love for gardening. 
                                I am currently an active member in two clubs: Interact and PATCH, both of which are volunteer clubs that I believe make a huge impact in the community. 
                                I have a cute black Pitbull Lab mix dog named Rex, and I've had him for almost two years.
